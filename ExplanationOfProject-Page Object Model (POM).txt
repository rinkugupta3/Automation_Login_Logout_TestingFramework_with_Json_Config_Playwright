Question: How would you design an automation framework using Playwright for a web application?
Answer:
When designing an automation framework using Playwright,
I would start by setting up a modular structure based on the Page Object Model (POM).
This helps separate the test scripts from the page-specific code, making it easier to maintain and scale.

1) Project Structure:
Create separate directories for page objects, test scripts, test data, and utilities.
Use a configuration file to store environment variables, test URLs, and other settings.

2) Page Objects:
For each page of the web application, create a corresponding class in the page object directory.
Each class will encapsulate the page elements and actions (e.g., login, submit forms).

3) Test Scripts:
Write test scripts in the test directory using a BDD approach with Playwright and a framework like Cucumber.
This allows writing human-readable scenarios in Gherkin syntax.
The test scripts will call methods from the page objects to perform actions and assertions.

4) Utilities:
Develop utility functions for common actions, such as handling authentication tokens, waiting for elements,
or taking screenshots.

5) Test Data:
Store test data separately in JSON or CSV files and load it dynamically into your tests to support data-driven testing.

6) CI/CD Integration:
Integrate the framework with CI/CD tools like Jenkins.
Configure Playwright to run headlessly during the CI pipeline and generate test reports automatically.

7) Reporting:
Implement detailed logging and reporting using tools like Allure or Playwrightâ€™s built-in reporter,
which will help analyze test results.
This framework would allow for scalable, maintainable, and efficient test automation.
